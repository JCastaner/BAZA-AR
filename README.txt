Hi this is Joseph and Ari

TO RUN THIS:
Here are steps to run the project. Edit mode will run easily using PC stuff like your camera. Build mode will let you use it as an app on phones, but takes longer as it has to be built.

EDIT MODE-
1) In the bottom left, click "Maximize on Play". Ensure it is selected.
2) Hit the play button at the top.
3) To stop, hit the play button again. Pause button will not stop it, simply pause it.

BUILD TO PHONE-
1) Open up the project.
2) Go to the top left of the editor, to File.
3) Click Build Settings...
4) Choose a mobile platform, we recommend Android as it is easiest.
5) Select Build and Run.
